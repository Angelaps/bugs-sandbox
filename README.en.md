Bugs can happen at any time. Therefore, we need to train to know how to organize and resolve them in the best way. GitHub is the ideal tool for organizing all issues of a project, informing all the bugs that need to be resolved, as well as new features and possible changes. With the issue tracker, we were able to divide the responsibilities for each member of our team.

This Sandbox serves as a training repository that started with code in different languages ​​containing some bugs that can be fixed. Some issues related to these bugs and other corrections were created and these issues will be shared among the class members for a practical activity.

Existing issues need not be the only ones. There may be other improvements that students can find and create new issues related to these improvements. It is a free repository for us to train our knowledge.
